### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying at Regis University to complete my master's degree.

I have just one class to complete and plan to be finished by mid-March 2023.

I created this Github account as a requirement for the final class I am taking but frankly, it has been a long time since I have done any coding and I'm starting to get out of my comfort zone.

(Not that that is a bad thing.)
